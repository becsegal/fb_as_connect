# Facebook Authentication Demo Using the ActionScript API

This demo uses the Facebook ActionScript API to display your Facebook profile pic and name if you're logged into  Facebook and have authorized the app.  If you you're not logged in or you haven't authorized the app, it shows you a button you can click to connect.  The app can authenticate with Facebook Connect if run from a non-Facebook site, or it can run as a Facebook app in an iframe canvas.
